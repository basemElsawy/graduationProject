              Powerlifting is composed of three lifts: the squat, bench press,
              and deadlift. Anyone who has ever worked out at a gym has either
              done bench presses or at least seen someone do them. Benches are
              so popular as you can handle greater weights in the bench press
              than any other upper body exercise. And they are a great exercise
              for chest, shoulder, and triceps development. But the other two
              lifts are not quite as popular, but they should be! Squats are the
              best exercise there is for developing leg and hip strength while
              deadlifts utilize just about every muscle in the body, so they
              develop total body strength. In fact, performing just the three
              powerlifts is about all one needs for a sound training program,
              and no other exercises will provide the strength and muscular
              gains that the three powerlifts provide. The page Proper
              Performance of the Powerlifts explains details in this regard, so
              it will not be repeated here. And for pics of yours truly
              performing the powerlifts, see APF PA States Powerlifting
              Championships - 2006 – Pictures. But it will be said here, if you
              are not incorporating these three lifts in your training program
              then you are not making the strength and muscular size gains that
              you could be. And of course, if you are thinking of competing in a
              powerlifting contest, you need to be performing the powerlifts in
              training.

            <p class="para-1">
              They say you can’t chase two rabbits. To that I say: shut up, I
              will do what I want! Power building is all about chasing two
              rabbit.<br />
              Essentially, power building is the process of building muscle size
              at the same time as building muscle strength and giving neither
              particular importance over the other.<br />
              As people become more and more interested in performance, the idea
              of getting stronger has become increasingly popular.
              <br />Meanwhile, simply building muscle size for the sake of
              appearances has started to fall out of favour. But here’s the
              problem: people still want to look strong! While you can pretend
              you don’t care what you look like at all, we all know you’re
              lying! This is a problem, seeing as generally the training methods
              involved in building strength are considered contrary to those
              used to build size. <br />Powerbuilding thus presents something of
              a challenge, in that your training has to be optimized for two
              separate (albeit related) goals. In this post, I’ll be looking at
              how powerbuilding works and at what the best way to train size and
              strength at the same time might be. At the same time, I’ll also be
              looking at some of the shortcomings of traditional methods and
              suggesting a few new ones of my own.

          <p class="para-3">
            Calisthenics, also called Street Workout, gained worldwide
            reputation after 2008 video of Hannibal for King went viral on
            YouTube. Since then, increasingly more people have trained it as
            well as national and international competitions have emerged. It
            derives its name from two Greek words kálos which means beauty and
            sthénos which means strength. Calisthenics is a discipline in which
            you train your whole body using only bodyweight exercises. You have
            probably seen people doing gravity-defying gymnastic figures such as
            Front Lever and Planche or dynamic acrobatic skills on the bars such
            as Muscle Up. This is the sole idea of Calisthenics – to perform
            workouts with nothing else but your own body.

            If you’re trying to develop an aesthetic body, a great first step is
            to get a visual image of how you want to look. A good idea is to
            find bodybuilders or athletes that are similar in height to you.
            They should have a physique like the one you want to develop. Do you
            want an aesthetic bodybuilding physique? You might want an aesthetic
            physique with a little less muscle. Regardless, you will need to
            work on your proportions, symmetry, balance, and conditioning. This
            means a small waist, a good V-taper, and quads big enough to make
            the knees look small. Also, the quads should have a good outer
            sweep. And, don’t forget the calves! For example, Samir Bannout was
            well-known for his aesthetics and proportions. Some may say Bannout
            has an artistic physique. He is 5’8” and competes around 198lbs.
            Looking at his physique, you may feel it has more flow and pleasing
            lines than, say, Frank Zane. Finding examples of an aesthetic body
            that is inspiring to you is a powerful motivator to help you create
            your own aesthetic physique? Study the physique so you can create a
            clear mental image and train accordingly to bring to life what you
            see in your mind.
